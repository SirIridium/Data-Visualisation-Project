# Data Visualisation Project

 CSA Project that will do with the project about visualisation of data.
 Will be built here and the git will be used as a way to run the files.
 the files will be run from within the code.org file because this is where it will be using the theatre class.
 -

 Our project revolves around the climate crisis, we have 3 graphs that can be displayed on a significant amount of data:

 Our code will handle CO2 using, Statistica, a free access graph, megatons per month and this will go back 83 years and this will be per month, (in billions of metric tons). 
 
 For the precipitation, using NOAA (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration), a free government weather data site, this will reach back around 1500 months, for the wet   and dry days of every month. 

 For the Temperature, using data from Underground Weather, a free funded weather data site, we have data going back for everyday of the year, highest and lowest for every day. 

* Using this you, need to run it in CODE.ORG because all of the visuals are API's of theirs and classes of theirs, so this is using their classes. *
