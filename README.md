# Data Visualisation Project

 CSA Project that will do with the project about visualisation of data.
 Will be built here and the git will be used as a way to run the files.
 the files will be run from within the code.org file because this is where it will be using the theatre class. 

Our project revolves around the Climate crisis, and the data we are using is going to involve the tons of CO2, 
pumped into the atmosphere every year for the past 100 years, and for the scanner implementation we are going to include; 

| tons of CO2 every year for the past 100 years | 
| temperature rise every year for the past 100 years |
| ice melted in tons every year for the past 100 years |
